# Comprehensive Banking Analytics
Welcome to the Comprehensive Banking Analytics project! This repository contains the code and documentation for an advanced banking analytics system designed to enhance risk management and improve the credit approval process. By leveraging machine learning models, this project aims to provide a robust credit scoring system and perform customer segmentation based on various factors such as banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.

## Project Overview
The Comprehensive Banking Analytics project aims to:

- Segment customers based on their banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.
- Develop a robust credit scoring system to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants.
- Integrate machine learning models into the credit approval process to enhance risk management.

## Features
- **Customer Segmentation:** Cluster customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors and demographics.
- **Credit Scoring:** Assess the creditworthiness of customers using classification algorithms.
- **Risk Management:** Improve the credit approval process by integrating predictive models.
- **Visualization:** Visualize data and model results for better insights and decision-making.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes various data sources, including:

- Banking behavior data (e.g., number of bank accounts, number of credit cards, interest rates)
- Transaction history data (e.g., total EMI per month, amount invested monthly)
- Demographic data (e.g., age, annual income)

## Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning algorithms have been employed in this project, including but not limited to:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

- **Best Overall Model:** The Random Forest Classifier stands out as the best performing model with the highest accuracy (0.8170),Precision (0.8181), recall (0.8170), and F1 score (0.8168), indicating that it is the best performing model for this dataset. The consistency across these metrics suggests it is a reliable and balanced model.
